# Learning Playwright Project

Welcome to my learning project where I explore Playwright - an automation testing tool for web applications. This project serves as my initial foray into working with Playwright and includes examples and demonstrations of basic functionalities.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viktor-dimitrov/playwright-basic.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd to-do-app
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the examples:**

    ```bash
    npx playwright test 
    ```

    This will execute the test scripts provided in the `tests` folder. Review the code in this section to understand how to use Playwright for automated testing.

## Requirements
